        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>At the time of the founding of our clinic, only the head doctor could work with a microscope, and the purchased device was the first and only one in the city. To date, all therapeutic treatment at the MediLine clinic is carried out using a microscope. The clinic has 4 microscopes and all 8 therapists are fluent in this technique. The recent trend shows that modern patients have become much more attentive to the aesthetic component of their smile. For many, just a beautiful and reliable design is no longer enough. Often they want to get even more beautiful teeth than nature could give. Therefore, now in our dentistry the share of author's works is growing. This is exactly the case when artificial teeth, made extremely carefully and aesthetically, can be compared with works of art. Keeping up with the times, and somewhere even ahead of it, our hygienists and periodontists have introduced hardware installations for complex treatment into daily practice. They allow not only to stop the process of inflammation of the gums and tissues surrounding the teeth, but also to restore lost health. Moreover, hardware methods of periodontal diagnostics, such as the Florida Probe, objectively and clearly show the result. The standard of dental treatment in our clinic is implantation. Our experts work with several systems of implants from the world's leading manufacturers. Aerobatics - the provision of a lifetime guarantee for this procedure!
